            "reviews": "“Calling Stellaris Europa Universalis in space is probably reductive, but it was the first thing I did in this review not because they are almost exactly alike, but because, when I put away my empires and get on with my day, the stories that have played out in these digital worlds embed themselves in my brain, and I so desperately want to tell people about them. Both games tickle the part of my brain that wants every battle to have some greater context, every move I make to be part of a larger narrative. Stellaris manages to do this without history to lean on, though, and does so with aplomb.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.pcgamesn.com\/stellaris-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCGamesN<\/a><br><br>“An excellent science fiction space strategy game”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/01\/arts\/gaming-introduction-basics-quarantine-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The New York Times<\/a><br><br>“Stellaris is one of the best space 4X strategy games around, allowing you to create your very own civilization, venture out into the unknown and meet new species as you explore the stars.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/these-pc-games-sale-will-make-staying-home-whole-lot-more-fun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Windows Central<\/a><br>",
